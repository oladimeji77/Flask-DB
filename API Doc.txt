Maintaining the Documentation

The API documentation should be maintained in a version control system, such as Git. This will allow you to track changes to the documentation and easily revert to previous versions if necessary.

The documentation should also be linked to from the web app's website. This will make it easy for developers to find the documentation when they need it.

I hope this helps!
